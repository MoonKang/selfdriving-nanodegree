# selfdriving-nanodegree

This repo is for projects involved in selfdriving nanodegree program. I personally found the program to be a nice introduction to self driving projects with hands-on projects in various topics.

It covers interesting topics in computer vision, deep learning, PID control, and EKF filtering.
Its first term is completed with use of python, tensorflow, and Keras, while I mainly used C++ for the second term.

### 1. Lane Detection
With use of opencv, I applied canny edge and hough transform to detect and draw lane in images

### 2. Traffic Sign Classifier
Used CNN to identify traffic signs
