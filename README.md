# selfdriving-nanodegree

This repo is for projects involved in selfdriving nanodegree program. I personally found the program to be a nice introduction to self driving projects with hands-on projects in various topics.

It covers interesting topics in computer vision, deep learning, PID control, and EKF filtering.
Its first term is completed with use of python, tensorflow, and Keras, while I mainly used C++ for the second term.

### 1. Lane Detection
Used a basic opencv and applied canny edge and hough transform to detect lanes in images

### 2. Traffic Sign Classifier
Used CNN to identify traffic signs \

### 3. Behavior Cloning
Used CNN to optimize steer angle and throttle in simulation\

### 4. Advanced Lane Detection & Vehicle Detection
Used opencv for distortion correction, image rectification, color transform to identify lanes robustly
Used SVM and opencv to detect and track vehicles\
