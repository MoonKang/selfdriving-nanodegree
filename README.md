# selfdriving_projects

This repo is for projects involved with Udacity's selfdriving nanodegree program. I personally found the program to be a nice introduction to self driving projects with hands-on projects in various topics.

It covers interesting topics in computer vision, deep learning, PID control, and EKF filtering.
Its first term is completed with use of python, tensorflow, and opencv, while I mainly used C++ for the second term.

### 1. Traffic Sign Classifier
* Used CNN to identify traffic signs \

### 3. Vehicle Detection
* Used SVM and opencv to detect and track vehicles\
